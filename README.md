# EventMate: Event Planner and Scheduler

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory.
3. **Important:** Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder and copy the contents from `.env.example`, then replace the values with your own MongoDB URI and Secret keys.
4. Run `npm install` in both `client` and `server` folders.
5. Start the backend with `npm start` and the frontend with `npm start`.
